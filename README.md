# generated-readme

For this week's assignment, we were tasked to create a README generator. This is the first time I've ever created a command line application and I found it to be a lot more staright forward than anticipated. I learned a lot by utilizing stackover flow and and google to trouble shoot any errors I kept running into. I also learned the difference between express commands and inquirer commands as well. Over all, I am grateful to have been able to try something new and get it working, cheers !
